Live url: https://www.bacchus.de/ 

## Idea
My client owns an online and offline shops. He has a loyalty system used offline that works as follows: a customer can pay 19€ and then receives a coupon worth 10% of the order that can be cashed in for an additional product on the same order. For example, a customer has a cart worth 90€. If he is a member of the loyalty club, he will get a coupon for 10% of the order (9€), which can be used to buy an additional product in the shop. The customer can only select wines up 9€ in value. If he selects a wine that is 8€, then he forfeits the 1€ that remains.
So, the goal was to develop a plugin which will allow implement a loyalty system in the online shop.
